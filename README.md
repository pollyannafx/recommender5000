# recommender5000
thing that recommends you electronic music


i have a hard time recc'ing music to other people sometimes, so i am literally creating a website people can go to to receive music recommendations from me. 

the recommender5000 will do this:
- let the 'player' first filter recommendations by genre (if they want trance, i'll fetch them trance; if they want breakbeat, i'll fetch them breakbeat) 
- ask 'player' to answer a few questions
- based on the questions asked, will ask 'player' to pick a word
- based on the questions asked, will ask 'player' to pick a phrase
- recommend you tracks based on the words 'player' picked - one track for our selected word and another for our selected phrase.

i'd like to clarify that this recommender5000 thing is still an idea. don't know how far i want to take this project. 
(at the very least, i'd like to create an API for songs that i associate with certain words and phrases) 

things i might add: 
- true/false on each json file if the songs warrant a content warning?
- true/false for explicit material? (so much of what i listen to is instrumental that idk if this is needed)
- tags for certain aesthetics i think the songs adhere to?

thing i should add and shouldnt forget:
- i should add cover art that the api can fetch.
- might also add brief song descriptions? idk how i'll fetch these idk if its a good idea to put them on the same json file
