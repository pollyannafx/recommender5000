- the sea
q2: why does this place attract you?
- its darkness has a strange sort of allure. it calls to me as i'm overcome with the reality that i will soon be gone like everyone else.

- i want to relive the memories of the people who once inhabited it. the place must've really meant something to folks at one point. 
q3: will you wander elsewhere when it's finally about time to die? 
- no, i'm becoming attached to this place myself 
- no, i'm too lazy to go anywhere
